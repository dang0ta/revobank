# Security Analysis of the RevoBank Banking System API
1. **Data Storage**: Replace in-memory storage with a proper database with transaction support
2. **Input Validation**: Implement comprehensive validation for all input data
3. **Access Control**: Add user-based access control to ensure users can only access their own data
4. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
5. **Encryption**: Add encryption for sensitive data at rest
6. **Transaction Safety**: Implement proper transaction handling to prevent race conditions
7. **Password Security**: Use proper password hashing with strong algorithms (bcrypt with good work factor)
8. **Security Headers**: Set proper security headers in HTTP responses
9. **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
10. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration testing of the API

These changes will significantly improve the security posture of the banking API while maintaining its functionality.
